🛒 RoboShop Shell Scripting Project – 3-Tier Architecture

----------------------------------------------------------------------
📌 About the Project

This repository contains end-to-end Shell scripts to automate the deployment and management of the RoboShop microservices application based on a 3-Tier Architecture model.

The project focuses on real-world DevOps practices by using Bash scripting to install, configure, and manage frontend, backend services, and databases on Linux servers (AWS EC2).

🏗️ Architecture Overview (3-Tier)

The application is designed using a 3-Tier Architecture, which separates concerns for better scalability, security, and maintainability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ Frontend Tier

Technology: Nginx

Serves static web content

Acts as a reverse proxy

Communicates with backend services via APIs

2️⃣ Backend Tier (Microservices)

Each backend service is deployed and managed using individual shell scripts:

Catalogue – Product information service

User – User authentication & profiles

Cart – Shopping cart operations

Shipping – Order shipment processing

Payment – Payment transactions

Services are managed using systemd service files

3️⃣ Database / Messaging Tier

MongoDB – Catalogue & User data

Redis – Cart & session storage

MySQL – Shipping data

RabbitMQ – Message queue for async communication (Payment → Dispatch)
